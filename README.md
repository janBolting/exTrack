# exTrack #

exTrack is a minimalist, easy to use excercise tracking service. 

### Features ###

- allows you to define your own exercises
- exercises are displayd numerically and graphically
- there will be an app that notifies you of the latest achievents of your mates (this adds hugely to your motivation to do a couple of hundred push ups a day)
- login works with google, facebook, and plain and simple = email+password
- allows you to add videos or pictures to each exercise, e.g. to show how a proper push up is done
